To run projects:
    1. Clone the project and open it in a code editor
    2. Run the command 'npm install'
    3. To run all tests use the command 'npx cypress open' and select e2e and Chrome respectively. Once you are taken to the test runner you can select specific tests to run
    4. Alternately, the command 'npm run test' or 'npm run test --headed' can be used to run all the tests at once. To run specific tests, the command 'npm run test:spec cypress/e2e/test/*insertnameofspecfilehere*.cy.js' can be run by substituting the highlighted section for the specific test fies under the test folder.


NB:
- The negative test scenarios can be found in the login portion as well as the customer information portion of the checkout scenario.
